        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare the tea: Steep the tea bags with 4 cups of just boiled water. Let the tea sit until it reaches room temperature. There‚Äôs no need to remove the tea bags from the water as the tea is steeping. You can stick the tea in the fridge to speed up the cooling process.<br><strong>Step 2:</strong>Prepare the simple syrup (if using): Add the water to a saucepan and heat the water until it starts to simmer. Add the sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the simple syrup cool before transferring to a jar.<br><strong>Step 3:</strong>Cook the tapioca pearls: Bring about 4 cups of water to boil and add the tapioca pearls. Stir the pearls and let them cook for about 5 minutes. The pearls should have floated to the top by now. Drain and rinse the pearls under cold water. Transfer them to a bowl.<br><strong>Step 4:</strong>Assemble the drinks: Divide the cooked tapioca pearls into 4 large glasses. Next, add a few ice cubes to each glass. Pour 1 cup of the tea into each glass. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of milk and 1 1/2 tablespoons of simple syrup into each glass. Stir and taste the milk tea. Add more milk or simple syrup to your taste. If you are serving the beverage to guests, have a small pitcher of milk and jar of simple syrup ready so that they can adjust the drink to their taste. The drink is usually served with large boba straws (large enough for the tapioca pearls to go through). If you don‚Äôt have the straws on hand, you can use spoons to scoop out the tapioca pearls.

        <p id="shaved-ice"><strong>Step 1:</strong>If using a special round container for the ice, fill with water and put in the freezer to make ice. Some machines will let you make shaved ice from regular ice cubes also. This is nice to have since you may not always have the special ice ready or have enough of it.<br><strong>Step 2:</strong>Open cans, package and clean berries and prepare each of the toppings for assembly.<br><strong>Step 3:</strong>Slice fruits.<br><strong>Step 4:</strong>Shave the ice into a bowl large enough to hold everything.<br><strong>Step 5:</strong>Order of toppings is not terribly important but to coat ice evenly, you may want to sprinkle the misugaru on ice using a small sieve.<br><strong>Step 6:</strong>Add berries and mini mochi cake. Spoon sweet red beans on top or on the side and then drizzle sweetened condensed milk.<br><strong>Tips:</strong>Bingsu has many variations and it's basically however you want to make it. You can have kids make their own bingsu with their own favorite toppings. You can also top with ice cream and nuts. Enjoy!!</p>

            <p><strong>Step 1 (Filling):</strong>Toast black sesame seeds (or peanuts) in a frying pan over low heat (see note 1).
In a food processor, grind cooled black sesame seeds (or peanuts) and sugar until they turn into a paste texture.
Add lard (or butter). Mix to combine then keep refrigerated until the mixture is firm enough to handle.
Divide into 20 portions. Shape each piece into a ball. Put them back in the fridge while preparing the dough.<br><strong>Step 2(Dough):</strong>In a mixing bowl, pour hot water into glutinous rice flour while stirring with a spatula.
Add room temperature water (or beetroot juice) little by little.
Knead with your hand until a smooth, soft dough forms (see note 2).Divide and roll into 20 balls.<br><strong>Step 3(Assembling)</strong>Flatten a piece of dough into a round wrapper with your fingers.
Place a ball of filling in the middle. Gently push the wrapper upwards to seal completely (see note 3).<br><strong>Step 4(Cook):</strong>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Gently slide in some Tang Yuan (see note 4).
Push them around with the back of a cooking spoon to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
When all the balls start to float on the surface, cook for a further minute.
Dish out (along with some liquid) and serve warm.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> <br>1. Keep a close eye on black sesame seeds while toasting. When the flat seeds plump up and are very easy to break when crushed with your fingers, they are done. Do not overcook as it would lead to an unpleasant burnt flavour.<br>
<br>2. The amount of room temperature water (or beetroot juice) required varies depending on the brand of the flour. Adjust if necessary. The finished dough needs to be smooth, very soft but not sticky. If you are not using the dough straightaway, wrap it with cling film to avoid drying out.<br>
<br>3. To make assembling easier, the filling should be quite firm (you may put them in the freezer for a short while to accelerate the process). Unlike dough made of wheat flour, the dough made of glutinous rice flour isn‚Äôt very elastic. It may crack during the assembling process (especially if it‚Äôs not soft enough). If cracks appear, wet the broken part with a tiny layer of water then rub gently to reseal.
<br>4. Cook Tang Yuan in batches. They expand while cooking (about 1.5 times bigger in the end) so make sure it‚Äôs not too crowded when all the Tang Yuan are floating on the surface.</p>
